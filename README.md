# Case study
The goal for the project was to create a technical documentation page to serve as instruction or reference of a topic of my choosing. I created the fictional framework StyleFlex, and made a simple and easy navigatable site with technical documentation. I worked mainly in HTML and CSS, as this was the objective for the certification, but I also integrated a little bit of JavaScript to make a scrollspy-function, showing where on the page the viewer was at, making it a little bit more intuitive.
